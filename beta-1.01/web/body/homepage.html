        Welcome to TKWP

    <p>
        <mark style="background-color: #ffff0036; color: #f5f5f5;">
            Unfortunely this website still under development. <br>
            Might be released soon.
        </mark>

    <h2>

    <p>
        The hardest thing to think was the "why". <em>"Why am' I creating this website, or even why I decided to do that"</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Well... I think it's because, initially, I really thought it would be a good idea to start my own business from scratch, without taking any money out of my pocket, or even if I had to, as little as possible. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Everything startded when I was playing minecraft with some of my friends and we were having some troubles with the many versions I was creating for the same modpack and with the constant updates I was doing in the server.
    </p>
    <p>
        So I thought I'd create a website to document all the changes to the Minecraft server and modpacks, as well as organizing all this documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        As well as storing everything related to the game servers we used to play, like a backup of them in case we want to play them again, even though we'll probably never play them again. But it's there as a souvenir.
    </p>
    <p>
        But this ideia endup been a website portfolio for my future projects.
    </p>
    <h2>
        _content_
    </h2>
    <p>
        There're a bunch of things I want to include in this website, like:
        <ol>
            <li>
                A decent homepage.
            </li>
            <li>
                A decent download page.
            </li>
            <li>
                A decent "about the server" page, including our contact information.
            </li>
            <li>
                I'll probably include a blog page for users to interact with each other.
            </li>
            <li>
                A server page, listing and describing all the servers we host, as well as services we'll provide to users.
            </li>
            <li>
                A sponsorship list page (services & benefits).
            </li>
            <li>
                And may be a forum, if that make sense.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        But that's obviously for the future.
